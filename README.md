# Webscraping

*This is a repository that shows how to websscrape items from ebay*

When given a search term, the code will search the given term and scrape the first 10 items list on the website
Along with the name, the code will also collect: Price (in cents), status (Brand new, Pre-owned etc.), Shipping 
costs (in cents), Free return status, and number of items previously sold. These information will be displayed 
in a JSON file that will be created in the folder. 

To use the code, simply load the ebay-dl.py file into vscode, click run then hit then pivot to the terminal.
Then, hit the up arrow when in terminal
After that, leave a space then type in the phrase you want to search:
For example, if you want to look for phones, type in 
`
"Phones"
`
Then click enter!
